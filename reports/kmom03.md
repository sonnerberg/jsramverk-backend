# Deployment

The project is hosted at [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) using [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/). 

## Digital Ocean

I found out a few years ago about [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) so I had already registered there before starting this course. So setting up my account and receiving my $50 credit through Github was no issue. 

I have some experience with [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) (AWS) since earlier because I studied the course "Introduktion till Cloud Computing" at [Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskola](https://www.bth.se/) a while back.

With the instructions at [jsramverk.se](https://jsramverk.se/) I had no problems setting up a droplet and getting started.
